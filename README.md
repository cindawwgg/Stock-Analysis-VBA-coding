# Analyzing Stock Data Using VBA Coding In Excel

### Description:

This assignment analyzes quarterly stock data to find stocks with the greatest increase/decrease and the greatest volume traded for the quarter. 

### Programming Languages: 
Excel - VBA

### Data Source:
Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.

### Process:

- There is one page for each quarter of stock data; the VBA code is accessed through the first page (Q1)
- The script loops through the quarter of stock data and reads/stores the ticker symbol, volume of stock, open price, and close price.
- The code calculates the total volume, quarterly change, and percent change for each unique stock.
- Conditional formatting is applied to appropriately distinguish whether stock price change was either negative (red) or positive (green)
- A table was added to each quarter to show the stock with the greatest % increase and % decrease as well as the greatest total volume.
- The code runs for each page in the workbook to capture the calculations for all 4 quarters.
